    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="small">Effective date: <strong>September 29, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>Thank you for playing <strong>Langur Burja</strong>. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, and your choices.</p>

    <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
    <p><strong>Langur Burja</strong> is developed and published by the developer reachable at <a href="mailto:nishcyber420@gmail.com">nishcyber420@gmail.com</a> (the "Developer").</p>

    <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
    <p>We collect two types of information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Non-personal information:</strong> Automatically collected data such as device model, operating system version, game performance metrics, crash reports, advertising identifiers (e.g., IDFA, GAID), and aggregated usage statistics (levels played, session length, events).</li>
      <li><strong>Personal information:</strong> We do not require players to register or provide personal details to play. If you contact us by email, you may provide your name and email address — that information is used only to respond to your inquiry.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Analytics</h2>
    <p>We use <strong>Google Analytics</strong> to collect aggregated usage and performance data to help us understand how players use the game and to improve features and stability. Google Analytics may collect device identifiers and other technical data. This data is used in aggregate and is not used to identify you personally by the Developer.</p>

    <div class="notice">
      <strong>Opt-out for Google Analytics:</strong> You can opt out of Google Analytics on some platforms by disabling ad personalization in your device or Google account settings, or by using Google’s analytics opt-out tools where available.
    </div>

    <h2>4. Advertising</h2>
    <p>Langur Burja displays ads served by <strong>Unity Ads</strong> and possibly other advertising partners. These ad networks may collect information (including advertising identifiers and device data) to deliver and improve ad experiences, and to measure ad performance.</p>

    <p>If you want to limit targeted advertising, you can change your device’s advertising identifiers or reset them, and adjust ad personalization settings on your device. For platform-specific instructions, check your device settings (Android / iOS).</p>

    <h2>5. How we use information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Improve and maintain the game (analytics, crash reports, performance tuning).</li>
      <li>Serve relevant advertisements and measure ad performance.</li>
      <li>Respond to support requests if you contact us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data sharing and third parties</h2>
    <p>We may share non-personal, aggregated data with third parties (for analytics or advertising). We do not sell personal information. Third-party providers, such as Google and Unity, operate under their own privacy policies and may use collected data as described by them.</p>

    <h2>7. Third-party links</h2>
    <p>The game may include links to third-party websites (for support, privacy policies of SDKs, etc.). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites. Please review any third party’s privacy policy before providing information.</p>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect information. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure — absolute security cannot be guaranteed.</p>

    <h2>9. Children</h2>
    <p>Langur Burja is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age in your country). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the applicable age. If you believe we have collected personal information from a child, please contact us and we will take steps to delete it.</p>

    <h2>10. Your rights & choices</h2>
    <p>Depending on where you live, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete personal information we hold about you. To exercise these rights or make requests, contact us at <a href="mailto:nishcyber420@gmail.com">nishcyber420@gmail.com</a>. We may ask for information to verify your identity before fulfilling requests.</p>

    <h2>11. International transfers</h2>
    <p>Data collected by analytics and ad networks may be transferred to servers located outside your country. By using the game, you consent to such transfers as described by the third parties’ policies.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. If we make material changes, we will update the "Effective date" at the top of this page. Continued use of the game after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>13. How to contact us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions, data requests, or privacy concerns, email: <a href="mailto:nishcyber420@gmail.com">nishcyber420@gmail.com</a>.</p>
